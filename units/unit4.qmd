title: "4) Data Frames"
---


## ðŸ“– Lecture

In this week, we discuss the basics of data frames, which are the dedicated object in R for handling tabular data sets.

- practice manipulating data frames (the "classic" way)
- describe in what sense a data frame is a list
- describe in what sense a data frame is a two dimensional object



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Describe and give examples of subsetting (subscripting, indexing) of an R data frame
- provide a manipulation example with single brackets, and 2-dimensions (e.g. `dat[rows,cols]`)
- provide a manipulation example with single brackets, and 1 dimension (e.g. `dat[wagons]`)
- provide a manipulation example with double brackets, and a single element `dat[[wagon]])`)
- provide a manipulation example with the dollar operator (e.g. `dat$wagon`)
