title: "2) R Vectors"
---


## ðŸ“– Lecture

In this unit we describe __data types__ and their implementation as __vectors__ (the most fundamental data object in R). We'll focus on important concepts like:

- main __data types__ ("atomic types" in R): logical, integer, real (or double), and character.

- __creation of vectors__: various ways and functions to create vectors.

- __implicit coercion__ rules: what R does when you combine values of different data types.

- __vectorization__: when R applies calculations or operations to all the elements of a vector (element-wise).

- __recycling__: what R does when you perform a calculation with vectors of different length.

- __subsetting__ (aka indexing, subscripting, bracket notation)
 


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Describe the four common data types in R, and give examples for them
- Explain why R vectors are said to be atomic objects
- Describe and give an example of the implicit coercion rules
- Describe and give an example of vectorized code
- Describe and give an example of the recycling rule
