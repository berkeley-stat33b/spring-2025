## ðŸ“– Lecture

This week, we continue describing functions that have to do with so-called input(s)-output(s), or simply put, with importing and exporting operations. For example:

- how to export a data table
- how to export a graphic to an image file
- how to export function outputs to external files



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Use the `sink()` function to export output to external files
- Provide an example for how to export an image with `png()` or `jpeg()` or `pdf()`
- Describe the mechanics that R uses for reading-in data
