title: "3) Matrices and Lists"
---


## ðŸ“– Lecture

We continue describing more data objects in R such as

- atomic objects: __matrices__ (and N-dim arrays)
- non-atomic objects: __lists__



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Create matrices with the function `matrix()`
- Explain how R internally stores matrices
- Describe why matrices are atomic objects
- Describe in what sense a list is considered to be a non-atomic vector
